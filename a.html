   <h2> 1.Deciding budget</h2>
    <p>
      Breaking down your wedding budget is one of the trickiest (yet most important) wedding planning tasks. Since this figure influences all other decisions—venue, guest list, meal options, and if you can spring for that pricey DJ—it's essential to create an accurate budget for the big day. No matter your starting number, think about dividing your wedding budget in terms of “for you” and “for them,” says Alicia Fritz of A Day in May Event Planning & Design. “A budget begins with a guest list that informs most of your costs. Be prepared to spend the most (around 40 percent) on taking care of guests basic needs—that's venue, food, and beverage.
      The remaining amount includes fixed costs including your photographer, videographer, and entertainment. Then, there's the more logistical and arbitrary stuff—transportation, labor, lighting, stationery, and anything else deemed essential.

   <h2>2.Finalizing Guest List</h2>
  <p>
    Your guests are going to be a big part of your wedding day, irrespective of whether you choose a cozy intimate arrangement, a large banquet, or a virtual-only option. But when is the right time to let them know and have them be involved in the run-up to the big day?.
    Build a rough draft list of possible guests you want at your wedding. Don't stop at just the family names—consider the number of members and include adults and children.
Share it with your partner or close family and friends to ensure you haven't missed anyone.
If you'll have a sit-down-style party and need to keep headcounts in check for the venue, catering, and budget, start assigning seating tables.
Revisit the guest list and finetune for an “almost final” list. Start adding in the postal and email addresses, depending on the type of invite you are sending out.
Get in touch with guests who will have to travel for your wedding by sending save the dates or making phone calls.
Ensure any other cultural provisions you have to make for your guests are noted.
Communicate any special requests you have of guests, such as cultural or religious considerations they might not be accustomed to or aware of.
Finalize your guest list for friends and family traveling from afar and send out invitations for anyone that has to travel to the wedding.
Send out save the dates for local guests.
Plan any accommodation arrangements for guests traveling to the wedding.

   <h2>3.Wedding venue selection</h2>
   <p>
    How to find the perfect Venue for your wedding? We have a detailed answer with step by step tips with inputs from Venue experts. Read to find your guide before you choose a wedding venue.
    Choosing the perfect wedding venue is so much more than just shortlisting one beautiful location to host the wedding. Apart from important factors like - Your wedding venue should be able to accommodate your entire guest list for all your pre-wedding and wedding ceremonies and the location of your venue should be easily accessible; millennial couples need to prioritise various other important details before they pick the wedding venue. 
    We are going to assume your total wedding budget is already planned by now! If you havent planned your expenses yet, check out the free Wedding Budget tool by WeddingWire India that helps you break your wedding budget down for different wedding planning requirements. Booking a venue is one of the most important decisions and investments from your total wedding budget. Once you have decided your venue budget, it's time to shortlist the venues in your preferred city as per your final budget. This will help you save time and make a practical decision when you are shortlisting dreamy wedding venues for the wedding day. 
    Your wedding venue cannot be perfect until it has the space and seating capacity to accommodate all your guests. Various venues like hotels and marriage gardens have multiple areas with different guest capacity and they host more than one wedding in a day. Keep an approximate guest list no. planned when you start shortlisting venues. You can talk to the venue managers and share your exact preference and guest list with them, and they can help you find the right area within their venue for your wedding ceremony and party.
    Brides and grooms-to-be usually have the aesthetic in mind from the beginning. You might be looking for venues alongside famous beaches because you want a destination beach wedding, forts and palace venues in India for the majestic venue vibe, and if you are looking for good wedding venues in your city, you might have basic references in mind like a farmhouse wedding, an open-air venue for a day wedding or perhaps, a pre-wedding venue with a swimming pool. 
    You cannot book the perfect wedding venue, until you are sure of your wedding date and time. Knowing which of the venues you like is available beforehand, always makes the decision of choosing the right venue easier.“The time of the celebrations also matter. If it is an indoor wedding, the property needs to have air-conditioned spacious common spaces. During evenings, the lighting needs to be taken care of.”

 <h2>4.cheaking latest trends for wedding</h2>
 
   <p>
    What's better than a big fat Indian wedding? Well, a big fat Indian wedding that's on trend.
    As the new year approaches, it's time to address the debate that's circling everyone's mind right now. What will be the wedding trends that will dominate 2023? When couples incorporated these trends into their weddings, it takes the whole celebration up a notch. These trends are the 'X Factor' every wedding deserves. While there are certain things about a good old traditional wedding that remain the same, there are certain trends that tend to change. This is partly because there is always a change in the way people wish to spend their money. Here are our predictions for wedding trends for 2023.
    Just like most things in the wedding world, photography styles are heavily influenced by trends. Back in the birth age of Pinterest, everyone was loving the look of sepia-toned photos and unconventional angles. However, now we've collectively moved on to the 'bright and airy' style of photography, focusing on natural soft lighting and candid moments. Couples are no longer concerned about everything looking perfect and are focusing more on having their photographers capture the day with minimal direction or interruptions. And photographers have moulded their work in the same way, creating editorial-style wedding albums for couples, focusing less on poses and more on imperfections and authenticity.
    If there's one thing we've learnt in the past few years, it's that couples love pre-wedding shoots (even if they slyly deny it). Similarly, post-wedding shoots have also become quite popular these days. However, no one wants to get shot indoors anymore. They did that during the pandemic and they're over it now. Couples want to breathe in the fresh air while getting clicked for their pre-wedding album. This gives them an opportunity to utilise various special locations in their cities like monuments and historical sites as the backdrop while getting gorgeous shots clicked in natural light. 
    While names like Sabyasachi and Manish Malhotra have become household names when it comes to bridalwear, they're not as affordable as we'd love them too. The end of 2022 saw a sudden rise in the popularity of homegrown, smaller labels that have a wider reach. And we're expecting this trend to trickle into 2023 with much finesse. From fresh labels to Hidden Gems, brides are moving towards labels and designers that capture their essence while staying within their budget. 
    However, we've witnessed a spike in the number of brides going for more earthy and neutral colours for their bridal lehengas. From deep red-browns to burnt oranges, sage greens, golds and even sap greens and purples, the love for such earthy tones for bridal lehengas is growing. And in 2023, we're definitely keeping our fingers crossed for more brides to embrace these unique colours. 
    Printed lehengas have our hearts! Easy-breezy & lightweight, printed lehengas have been around for quite some time now! We know brides have already begun embracing this fail-safe trend for their pre-wedding functions and we suggest brides-to-be definitely consider this one. From floral lehengas to ones with geometric patterns & chevrons, there's so much you can experiment with! Plus, the highest selling point is that these beauties allow you to frolic about freely & enjoy your celebrations to the fullest.

  <h1>Three to five month before the wedding</h1>
  <h2>5.Choose The Caterer</h3>
  <article>
   <p>
    It doesn't matter if you live to eat or eat to live, when it comes to your wedding day, good food is a non-negotiable. (Simply put, nobody wants to deal with hangry guests.) Choosing the right caterer is one of the most crucial tasks on your to-do list.
    Whether you are putting your foodie status on full display with an innovative assortment or paying homage to your and your partner's favorite dishes, a menu should be as personal as every other part of your wedding. But, can a prospective caterer rise to that occasion.
    Honestly, very few things can ruin a meal like a cold or soggy dish. Before you commit to a caterer, ask them how each course is prepared. 
    If you can't taste the food for yourself, you might as well see what everyone else has to say about the menu. “Catering is going to be a large part of your event team, so be sure that you enjoy your conversations and the booking process, and also that you see good reviews online.
    While reviews should always be taken with a grain of salt—especially since everyone's taste buds are different—you might start to notice some common themes.
    As the saying goes, money talks. Though a catering company's website or social media platforms  might be filled with perfectly plated courses that are worthy of a Michelin star, it's important to understand what they can actually do with your budget.

  <h2>6.Wedding Invitation Selection</h2>
  <article>
    <p font-size="24px">
      Thoughtful and pre-discussed Indian wedding invitation wording can save you a lot of time and money over the loss of misprints and confusions. This information will help you check all the important Indian wedding invitation wording pointers for a smooth finalisation of the content.
      The first thing that needs to be decided is, on whose behalf will the invitations be drafted for the guests. While some Indian wedding card designs include names of both the grandparents as invitees, others mention parents as being the invitees with a subtext mention of the grandparents' names as co-invitees.
      There are various western and Indian ways of salutations that we often come across in Indian wedding invitation wording while addressing the people. You can pick between Mr. & Mrs., Shreeman & Shrimati Ji or the abbreviation versions Shree & Smt while addressing parents, grandparents and in-laws.
      If the families want to keep the invitation simple, then you can go ahead with providing just the details in terms of Indian wedding invitation wording for the invites. But in case you want to make the wording fancier, browse the internet to find a unique quote that you feel will be apt for the wedding and your personal perspectives.
      In the case where the bride and the groom's families are keeping wedding card invitations separate, the first person's name gets decided easily. But in cases wherein both the parties co-create one invitation card, it is essential to decide whose name will come first in Indian wedding invitation wording format. As the norm goes, the name of the bride gets featured first, followed by that of the groom and his parents and grandparents next.
      Right before you share event details, it is essential to write a two liner on behalf of the invitees in the Indian wedding invitation wording format. A message that says The invitees would like to request the presence of the guests to witness the bride and the groom tie the knot in holy matrimony'can very well be used.

  <h2>7.Contacting Photographer And Videographer</h2>
  <article>
    <p>
      A wedding celebration is one of the happiest moments in people's lives, but it only lasts a day. There is no reason memory should be left to slowly fade away. Our wedding videography team blends with the background while they unobtrusively capture all the important and in-between moments of your special day. We at the New Jersey Wedding Studio are passionate about telling unique stories by capturing the atmosphere and emotions of the most important day in your life!
  Before deciding on a wedding video package, take a look at our wedding video editing options and build the package that perfectly fits your vision.
  Whether you write your own or utilise more traditional vows, they will have a profound impact on your wedding day. A video recording of a conversation is the best way to recall the words and feelings exchanged between you and your companion. Even when your recollection of the incident blurs with the passage of time, the film will always look fresh and have the same impact.
  Wedding photographers and videographers serve different purposes, and the happy couple and event planner should be aware of this. They don't compete with one another because they're in such different fields.
 It's a question we hear a lot, and one we find to be ridiculously silly: "Does the photographer also take video?" (and vice versa). This is because it's commonly believed that if you can take nice photos, you can also make good videos.

  <h1>8.Entertainment Preparations</h1>
  <article>
    <p>
      Weddings in India are one of the biggest carnivals hosted by families in the social and cultural front. Even an intimate wedding involves your near and dear ones from the family and your favourite group of friends. There are a lot of people involved at a wedding - right from the pre-wedding ceremonies or even before that. 
     1. Call the Magician.
      There is no human who does not find magicians fun! You heard us. From a kid of 5 to your uncle who might be 55 years old, everybody enjoys a magic show and to build the fun and mystery at the wedding party, you can include a magician in your itinerary for the evening. Let the man pull out some burgers from the inside of his hat or some flowers out of your friend's ears and make the crowd break into squeals of laughter and awe!
     2. Break a leg with the DJ.
     A DJ is a must-have at a wedding! How is it even legal to not have the last dance where one of your bridesmaids loses her shoes? Let your hair down with your entire family enjoying the twists and thumkas. Ask the DJ to play all your favourite tracks and sweat all your stress out from the wedding on the dance floor.
     3.call Indian play back Singer.
     Indian play back singer is a trending entertainment for weddings these days. Be it on the eve of your Sangeet or the reception party, you can call for a singer to make your evening an unforgettable and jaw-hurting (for all the good reasons of course) affair! You will have to consider your guests before you pick this as your wedding entertainment idea because the thin line between song and danceing is often mistaken and it might be offensive for the guests.

  <h2>10.Get Your Makeup Artist On Board</h2>
  <p>
    Wedding planning is no small feat: just ask any of your married friends. Among the 100 other things that are important when it comes to making your big day flawless, picking the right makeup artist and a hairstylist is right up there on top. Just like you go through multiple designer options, trials and fittings when it comes to wedding outfits, researching your bridal makeup looks and hairstyles to make sure everything is in sync is of utmost importance—and so is having the right team on board.
    While you might not entirely know what you want when it comes to makeup and hair, go into your conversation at least having a rough idea. If you'd like to go all out with your makeup, look for a makeup artist whose extravagant style appeals to your taste. If you prefer minimal makeup, choose an artist whose forte is that, as opposed to someone who creates glitter smoky eyes on the regular. It's essential that you, your makeup artist and hairstylist are on the same page so you're not in for a surprise on the actual day.
    Makeup trials are the real deal breaker, once you've shortlisted two-three makeup artists whose work you like. Make sure you come prepared with at least swatches of your outfit and the jewellery you will be wearing. “Ideally the clothes should be ready so the makeup artist and hairstylist can recommend the best looks. Only once they know how high the collar is or if the neck is low or not can they put together the entire look. It's important to know how heavy the jewellery will be as well. Everyone should be on the same page”.

  <h2>11.Start Planning Your Honeymoon</h2>
  <p>
    Dream. Think about where you've always wanted to go to celebrate your marriage, and get inspired by people, magazines and websites.
    If you're budgeting your holiday in tandem with your wedding, you will likely know at this point what funds you are hoping to allocate to your trip and can compare your budget against that dream list of destinations.
    Properly slot in your travel dates after calibrating for personal commitments and taking into account the optimal time-as you deem it-for visiting your destination of choice.
    Cement the foundations of your plans, scouting airplane tickets, booking must-have items on your checklist (hotels, visa, park permits) and firming up a version-in very broad strokes-of what your itinerary might look like (which days in which destination for multi-stop trips).

  <h2>12.Shop For Jewelry</h2>
  <article>
    <p>
      If you think about it, bridal jewellery is about more than just adding the right finishing touches to your wedding celebration outfits—it marks the different stages of your courtship as a bride-to-be as well. First comes the ring, followed by the engagement party, where Indian customs dictate that the groom's family gift the bride her jewellery, and then there's the trousseau shopping. All of this ultimately culminates on the big day, with the future missus sporting jewellery that (more often than not) channels her inner princess.
      A trend that is quickly catching on is one of the couple investing in matching wedding bands to solidify their commitment to each other. It's advisable to choose a ring design that complements your engagement ring, so that it can be stacked together. Gold rings (white, yellow or rose—pick your favourite) and platinum rings are timeless favourites. You can go a step further and have your wedding date or hashtag engraved on yours, to always have a memory of your special time on hand.
      Many brides choose their lehenga first and then follow it up with the jewellery, though it's advisable to do the opposite. Your wedding set will be a hefty investment, so choose timeless over trendy. 
      Gone are the days when wedding sets simply gathered dust in the bank vault. The goal today is to invest in trousseau pieces that allow for easy wearability. Buy detachable, multi-purpose necklaces that can make a statement at the next family wedding, but can also be broken down for a more laid-back festive dinner party.
      While heavy necklaces are an important element in a bride's trousseau, so are lighter pieces that can be worn for your pre-wedding events, as well as for a friend's wedding a few months down the line. For her mehandi, Bipasha Basu paired her floral jewellery with a satlada that can be repurposed with everything from a kurta set to a sari with flair. Multi-layered gemstone necklaces like emeralds, rubies and pearls are versatile picks as well, since they can be dressed up or down.

Gold is considered as the metal of the gods, hence, it is considered vital in all wedding traditions, especially the wedding look of the bride-to-be. Kerala dress code for the bride consists of the famous Kasavu saree which is an all plain-white saree with golden border. Kasavu saree is considered as the most auspicious form of Kerala dress that woman also wear for special occasions apart from adorning it on every Hindu new year. The Kasavu saree was originally known as 'Mundum Neryathum', with its origin dating back to the Buddhist era. This saree is traditionally worn in Tissue cotton fabric but the brides-to-be of now have become fond of wearing the silk version of Kasavu saree more than the cotton one. And with the often changing traditions, brides-to-be have modified a traditional Kasavu saree, illuminating from the stark-white to a mellowed-down red or a leafy-green colour scheme with golden kara as the wedding trousseau.
The groom is given a choice of wearing the traditional Mundu with a shirt, kurta or remain bare-chested with just a Melmundu worn around the shoulder to complete the look. Just like the female Kasavu style of saree, a Mundu is worn in tissue cotton fabric. Keeping up with the auspiciousness of gold, a Mundu too is the groom’s Kerala dress consisting of golden border known as Kara with a scope of experimenting with the borderline design, apart from the pleating style.

  <h2>15.Schedule Your Pre-Wedding Shoot</h2>
  <article>
    <p>
      Pre-wedding photos can be used on save-the-date cards, wedding invitations, or even on the reception welcome board.

Sometimes the couple will wear their wedding dress and tuxedo - this is typical with Asian engagement photoshoots.

However, with western pre-wedding shoots, the couple usually wears something casual that reflects their personalities.

In this guide, we'll look at some pre-wedding shoot ideas and poses for both the couple and the photographer.

We'll also answer some of the most frequently asked questions about engagement sessions and wedding photography in general.
It's important for the wedding photographer and the couple to meet or at least video chat before the engagement photo shoot.

This is beneficial for both because most couples haven't experienced a professional photo shoot before this moment. So, this gives them the chance to ask all the questions they have about what they can expect.
Even the best locations aren't perfect for all pre-wedding sessions. You must choose the right location for the couple you are photographing.

For example, if they are nature lovers, you can hold the engagement session in the park. Instead, if they love partying and city nightlife, you can take photos in a busy street with colourful neon lights or inside a nightclub.

  <h2>16.Follow Up With The Vendors</h2>
  <article>
   <p>
    The finale of the how to choose a wending vendor series, we are going to give our final tip. You've made the inquiry, you've had the interview, perhaps you've met a vendor at a bridal show …. now let's assume you have the proposal. What are the best steps in following up.
    Tell the Vendor No: It's not easy to “let people down” and certainly as the consumer you are not obligated to do anything after receiving the proposal. But I highly suggest sending an email or leaving a vendor a phone call to let them know that you have decided to not use their services. It allows them to move on and to fill your date.
Ask the Vendor Questions: If the proposal is ambigious then please ask questions of the vendor for further clarification.
If the Vendor Asks: Sometimes vendors would like to know why you went “a different direction” or chose a different vendor. Please, let them know. This helps them be a better business person.
Don't Assume: There are ONLY so many dates available for weddings. Therefore it is in your best interest to make a decision with a vendor as soon as possible.
Note to Vendors:
Because we know that vendors read our blog as well, we HIGHLY encourage you to respect potential client's wishes by following their requests. If they ask to be contacted my email only, then please don't GOOGLE them to find out their home phone number to make sales solicitations. (You think we are making this up?)
If you have asked for feedback as to why they did NOT choose you, then listen to them. Do not argue or try to change their mind. It makes you look, well, lame.
We ask clients to respect our time, please respect theirs as well. Get back with them in a timely manner (very hard to do all the time), be prepared for your meeting and contact them.
Lessons we ALL need to remind ourselves, everyday. Including us.
We hope this series has helped you with a few quick tips on how to choose a wedding vendor. There are many other tips out there and we wanted to take it from a different direction. It's not rocket science, but sometimes we all forget the simple steps.

ps Stop by our booth this Sunday at the Super Bride Sunday! Let us know if you read the series!

plan on!
